// Package dsext (data structure extensions) contains extensions to the standard library: slices, maps, and sets (a new type).
// It provides utility functions for working with slices and maps.
// Additionally, it provides the [Set] type, which is a set implementation backed by a map. Sets can be created using
// the built-in [make] function. Alternative constructors are provided for convenience: NewSet[Slice|Seq|Cap].
